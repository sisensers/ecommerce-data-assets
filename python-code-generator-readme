# Commerce Data Generator

## Overview

The Commerce Data Generator is a Python script designed to create synthetic transaction data for a commerce dataset. It leverages the Faker library to generate realistic customer names and dates, producing a CSV file containing transaction information. This README provides an overview of the script's functionality and guidance on how to customize the generated data.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install faker pandas
```

### Running the Script

To run the script and generate synthetic transaction data:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python commerce_data_generator.py
   ```

4. The script will generate a CSV file named "CommerceTable.csv" containing the synthetic transaction data.

## Customization Options

The script offers several variables that can be adjusted to customize the generated data:

### 1. Number of Rows (`num_rows`)

The `num_rows` variable controls the total number of rows or transactions to be generated. Update this variable to specify the desired size of your dataset.

### 2. Number of Transactions per Customer (`min_transactions` and `max_transactions`)

Adjust the `min_transactions` and `max_transactions` variables to define the range for the number of transactions per customer. This introduces variability in the number of transactions each customer can have.

### 3. Gender Distribution (`female_weight`)

The `female_weight` variable determines the percentage of female customers in the generated dataset. By default, it is set to 62%. Modify this value to achieve the desired gender distribution.

### 4. Countries (`country`)

Currently, the script is configured to generate transactions for the "United States." If you want transactions in different countries, you can modify the `country` variable within the script.

### 5. Additional Fields

The script includes various other fields such as `Product_ID`, `Category_ID`, `Brand_ID`, etc. You can explore the script and update these fields based on your specific requirements.

Feel free to experiment with these variables to generate datasets tailored to your specific needs.

## Example:

```python
# Update the number of rows to generate 5000 transactions
num_rows = 5000

# Update the range for the number of transactions per customer
min_transactions = 1
max_transactions = 5

# Adjust the female weight to 50%
female_weight = 0.5

# Change the target country to "Canada"
country = "Canada"
```

By customizing these variables, you can generate diverse datasets suitable for testing, analysis, or any other purposes.
